Python-BashScript
=================

In residence at UBC, they monitor our web usage, capping each student at 7GB. If you reach 7GB, you are put into what they call "the penalty box" but I like to all it internet jail. I am told that if you are a repeat offender in one week (i.e. you pass the 7GB limit twice in one week), they will throw you in jail for the next weekâ€“a week of tortuously slow internet in which even a simple web page with only text takes about 6 minutes to load. They say that it is to prevent illegal streaming, but until they figure out a way to differentiate my completely legal Netflix usage from others' illegal streaming, I created a combination bash and python script to warn me when I am reaching the cap. 

UBC respectfully provides a web page that informs you of your usage (which they check every ~15 minutes). What I did was downloaded the web page, extracted the inbound GB usage, and if it is under 6.70GB do nothing, but if it is at or above 6.70GB, show a pop up window that warns me of my usage. Using crontab, I scheduled this script to run every 20 minutes. 

Feel free to use the script. If you do though, please note that this can only run on OS X systems, and please remember to change the paths to the executables.
